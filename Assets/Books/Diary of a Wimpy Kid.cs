        "First of all, I want to get something straight: this is a JOURNAL, not a diary. I know what it says on the cover but when Mom went out to buy this thing I SPECIFICALLY said to make sure it didn't say \"diary\" on it. So don't expect me to be all \"dear diary this\" and \"dear diary that\". All I need is for some jerk to catch me carrying this thing around and get the wrong idea. The other thing I want to clear up right away is how this was NOT my idea, it was Mom's. The deal is that if I write in this book a little bit each day I get out of one chore on Saturdays, so of course I picked the one I hate the most. But if Rodrick ever finds out he's scrubbing toilets because of this book, I'm dead.",
        "Oh yeah Rodrick's my brother. I try to avoid him anyway but now that I struck this deal with Mom, I better be extra careful. Anyway I think Mom has this idea I'm going to write down my \"feelings\" and all that, but she's not actually allowed to read it so I figure I'll just write what I want. The real reason I agreed to do this at all is because I figure later on when I'm rich and famous I'll have better things to do than answer people's stupid questions all day long. Like I said, one day I will definitely be famous, but for now I'm stuck in the seventh grade with a bunch of morons.",
        "Today is the first day of school and right now we're just waiting around for the teacher to hurry up and finish the seating chart. So I figured I might as well write in this book and just get it over with for the day. But I'll tell you something... on the first day of school, you got to be real careful of where you sit. You walk into the classroom and just plunk your stuff down on any old desk and the next thing you know the teacher is saying \"I hope you all like where you're sitting because these are your permanent seats\". So in this class I got stuck with Chris Hosey in front of me and Lionel James in back of me. Otha Harris came in late and almost sat next to me but luckily I did some quick thinking and got myself out of that one.",
        "I'm thinking for next period I should just sit in the middle of a bunch of cute girls as soon as I step in the room. Then again if I do that it just proves that I didn't learn a thing from last year. Plus the other thing I got to think about is that girls don't let you copy off of them, which could be a real problem in a class like Pre Algebra. Speaking of seating, something that really stunk today is how in home room I got stuck with some teacher who had Rodrick in his class a few years back. The only good thing I can think about the first day of school is that some of the teachers are new and so you can slide a little.",
        "Anyway the teacher is almost done with the seating chart and I think I wrote enough in this book to keep Mom off my back for today. This morning Mom made me lend my brother Rodrick some of my money so he could buy lunch, which really stunk. I'm still mad at Rodrick for the trick he pulled on me at the beginning of the summer so I'm really not looking to do him any favors. What happened was that on the first day of summer vacation, he woke me up in the middle of the night dressed up in his school clothes. He told me I slept through the whole summer but that luckily I had woken up in time for the first day of school. You might think I'm pretty dumb for falling for that one, but I was too groggy to know any better and plus Rodrick had set my clock ahead and pulled the blinds shut. So I just got up and got dressed and went downstairs to fix myself some breakfast. I must've made a big racket because the next thing I knew Dad was in my face wondering what the heck I was doing eating Cheerios at 3 a.m.",
        "The thing about Dad when he comes downstairs late at night is that he's always just wearing a tee shirt and some boxer shorts. I don't know which is worse, getting yelled out or having to see your father in his underwear. I keep meaning to ask him to please put on some more clothes the next time he comes downstairs but the right opportunity never comes up. Anyway it took me a couple of minutes to figure out what all was going on. When I told Dad Rodrick tricked me Dad stomped on down to Rodrick's room in the basement and I followed along. I was pretty excited to finally see Rodrick get what was coming to him.",
        "But when we got down there Rodrick had covered up his tracks pretty good and you would never know he had been up to something. Dad just threw up his hands and went back up to bed. So now Dad thought I was an idiot AND a liar. Come to think of it ever since Dad has been real suspicious around me, like I'm turning into a bad kid or something. I'll put it to you this way... if I'm going to do something bad and take the heat like I did that night you better believe I'm going to come up with something a lot more satisfying than eating a bowl of Cheerios in the middle of the night. Today in Social Studies I scored pretty big. The teacher made us sit in alphabetical order so the way things fell out I ended up right next to Alex Aruda who is the smartest kid in the class. He's super easy to copy off of because he always finishes his tests early and then just puts his paper on the floor next to him while he reads a science fiction novel or something.",
        "Kids whose last names start with the early letters ALWAYS end up being the smartest because they get called on first. Some people think that's not true but if you want to come over to my school I can prove it. I can only think of one kid who broke the last name rule, and that's Peter Uteger. He was the smartest kid until the middle of the fifth grade. That's when a couple of us started giving him a hard time about what his initials spelled every chance we got. Now he doesn't raise his hand at all which makes for other kids to step forward and take the Smartest Kid title. I feel a little bad about the whole P.U. thing because I'm one of the guys who started it. But it's hard not to take credit for it whenever it comes up. I figured out another good thing about writing this journal: when I'm famous, I can cash in on it. I just have to remember to keep it away from Manny, my little brother. If you have something valuable in the house, believe me, Manny will find a way to destroy it. Back before Manny came along I remember I was all excited about getting a little brother. After all those years of Rodrick picking on me I figured it was my turn to be a little higher on the totem pole.",
        "But being a big brother didn't turn out like I expected at all. Mom and Dad protect Manny so I can't pick on him, even if he does something to tick me off. Plus, he's never gotten punished for anything, and believe me, he's deserved it a bunch of times. Just the other day he somehow got into my room and used a bunch of magic markers to decorate my door. I thought Mom and Dad would really let him have it but as usual, I was wrong. So now I'm stuck waking up to this horrible drawing staring at me everyday. Mom won't let me paint over it or even cover it up with a poster because she says it might hurt Manny's feelings. The only good thing about getting a little brother is that now, Rodrick doesn't make me sell his stupid chocolate bars for school fundraisers any more.",
        "The worst thing about Manny is that when he was real little he couldn't pronounce \"brother\" so he started calling me \"Bubby\". And Mom and Dad didn't make him call me my real name when he COULD say it. Luckily none of my friends have found out yet but I have had some really close calls. Yesterday was the first day of P.E. and we started the football unit. The first thing I did was sneak off to the basketball courts and check to see if the cheese was still where it was at the end of last school year, and sure enough it was. That thing has been sitting on the court since at least last fall and it has caused a whole lot of trouble. It's all moldly and nasty, and ever since it showed up, people have been trying to avoid it. To give you an idea of how people will go out of their way to stay away from the cheese, it's sitting right under the only hoop with a net in it but nobody's played on that court for a year.",
        "Darnell Washington tripped and fell and brushed the cheese with his finger last year and started this whole thing called the Cheese Touch. It's basically like Cooties, where if you get touched with the Cheese Touch then you have it until you pass it on to somebody else. The only way to protect yourself from the Cheese Touch was to cross your fingers. But it was really hard to remember to keep your fingers crossed all the time, especially when whoever had the Cheese Touch was looking for his next victim.",
        "So I taped my fingers together for the last couple weeks of school. I ended up getting a \"D\" in handwriting but it was totally worth it. This one kid named Abe Hall got the Cheese Touch in April and nobody would even sit at the same table with him at lunch for the whole rest of the year. This summer he moved away to California and he took the Cheese Touch with him. Nobody has touched the cheese ever since then, not even with a stick. Well the first week of school is finally over so I can sleep late again. Most kids set their alarms and get up early on Saturday morning to watch cartoons or whatever, but not me. The way I know it's time for me to crawl out of bed is when I can't stand the taste of my breath anymore.",
        "Unfortunately Dad wakes up at 6:00 in the morning no matter what day it is and he is not real considerate of the fact that I am trying to enjoy my Saturday. Other than the Saturday morning vacuuming me and Dad get along pretty good. But Rodrick and Dad is another story. It doesn't help that Rodrick is a teenager, which is Dad's least favorite type of person. I think if there was a petition to ship all of the teenagers in the state to Australia or Alcatraz or something, Dad would be the first person to sign it. And the first teenager he'd put on the boat would be this kid named Lenwood Heath. Lenwood is always toilet papering peoples' houses and generally stirring up trouble in the neighborhood.",
        "Dad has seemed a lot more relaxed ever since August when Lenwood's dad shipped him off to some military academy in Pennsylvania. While I'm on the subject of Saturday I should mention some of my other gripes. First of all, there's nothing on t.v. after 1:00 p.m. except golf and bowling. Second of all the sun comes right through the sliding glass window and you can hardly see what's on the t.v. anyway. And on top of that you get all sweaty and stick to the couch. It's practically like a consipracy against kids to make them go outside and do something besides watch t.v. Today after Dad woke me up I decided to just skip the whole t.v. thing and go over to Rowley's. I know I haven't mentioned Rowley in this journal yet even though he's technically my best friend, but there's a pretty good reason for that. Rowley kind of ticked me off on the first day of school with something he said at the end of the day when we were getting our stuff from our lockers.",
        "I told Rowley at least a billion times this summer that now that we're in middle school you're supposed to say \"hang out\", not \"play\". But no matter how many times I kick him in the shins when he says \"play\" he always forgets for the next time. So I guess you could say I've been avoiding Rowley this week. I've been trying to be more careful about my image ever since this summer when we got caught playing Vikings and Indians in the woods by a couple of eighth graders. What really burned me up about that whole incident is how that guy called me a nerd. Now I'll admit I'm not exactly the most macho guy around in terms of wanting to do push-ups all the time or whatever, so if you want to call me a wimp, then fine. But I know one thing for sure, and it's that I am NOT a nerd. The trouble with nerds is that they give wimpy kids like me a bad name, because people end up lumping us all in the same category. When I think of nerds, I think of teachers' pets and tickle fights and hall monitors, and that is not me.",
        "Now Rowley can speak for himself on the whole \"nerd\" thing, but I will just mention as a side note that he is the only 12-year-old I know who still has a babysitter. Rowley moved here a couple years ago and I kind of took him under my wing. My former best friend Ben moved to Piscataway and I figured I'd better find myself a new friend to hang out with, so here comes Rowley straight out of Ohio. His mom bought him some book called \"How to Make Friends in New Places\" and he showed up at my door trying out all these gimmicks. All that kid would've had to have done is to have come right out and told me he had a Playstation with 42 games and it would have sealed the deal. The best thing about having Rowley around is that I get a chance to use all the tricks Rodrick used on me that I could never get away with pulling on Manny.",
        "Another bonus about Rowley is that he has never squealed on me, not even once. So in some ways I guess you could say he's the perfect friend. Today was a really bad day. Dad ended up running into Mr. Swann at church and Mr. Swann was telling Dad how great Bishop Garrigan High School is, where his son Dan goes. Dad seemed REAL interested, which is a very bad sign for me. Now I'm sure Bishop Garrigan is a fine school and all that except for the fact that it is ALL BOYS. Number one I want to go to Crossland High School where there are boys AND girls and number two I wouldn't survive the first day at Bishop Garrigan.",
        "Rodrick doesn't have to worry about getting sent to Bishop Garrigan because he is already a junior at Crossland, but I had definitely better figure a way out of this. Mr. Swann went on and on about how Bishop Garrigan makes \"men\" out of boys. And from the way Dad kept looking over at me I knew I was in trouble. It doesn't help that Mr. Swann has three boys who are the same ages as us Heffley boys, and Dad's carpool passes by their house every night. As far as the whole \"making men out of boys\" idea goes, I think the Swann boys have a pretty good head start. I've still got two years before I go to high school, and hopefully Dad will forget about Bishop Garrigan by then. But if things look bad down the road I better start working on Mom to change my fate.",
        "Today I woke up and at first I thought it was still summer vacation, which is a really bad way to start a school day. The new thing is that I have to fix Manny his cereal every morning while Mom gets ready for work. Manny takes his bowl and sits right in front of the t.v. on his plastic potty. It's not like he's not potty trained but he got in the habit of doing this when he was two and he just never quit. The worst part is that after he's done he dumps whatever he didn't eat right into the potty. And it's always me who has to clean it up. Mom always gets on me about not finishing my breakfast, but if you had to scrape a bunch of Cheerios out of a potty every morning I bet you wouldn't have any appetite either.",
        "Today at school we got assigned to Reading groups. I was looking forward to finding out which group I was going to get put into because I wanted to see if a big plan I hatched at the end of last year was going to work. Now, they don't come right out and tell you if you're in the hard group or the easy group, but you can figure it out right away by looking at the covers of the books they give you. I was pretty mad to find out I got put in the hard group today, which meant my plan failed. I was hoping to get in the easy group because they only have to read about a tenth of the stuff that the kids in the hard group have to read, and there's a whole lot less homework.",
        "At the end of last year I did my best to muff up my screening test to make sure I didn't get put in the hard group. Another thing I did to make sure I didn't get put in the hard group was to make sure I didn't try to hard on my end-of-the-year essay. They make you do this four page paper at the end of the year which is another way they figure out how to place you. I'm guessing Mom stepped in and made sure I got put in the hard classes, because she knows the principal of the school. Mom's always saying how I'm a real smart kid but I just don't \"apply\" myself. You might wonder why I'd want to get put in the easy classes since I probably deserve to be in the hard classes, but I have a pretty good answer for that.",
        "If there's one thing I learned from Rodrick, it's to set people's expectations real low so you end up surprising everyone by doing almost nothing at all. In fact he did something on Friday that totally proves my point. Anyway I guess I'm glad my plan didn't work because I noticed at least two of the kids in the Bink Says Boo group were holding their books upside down, and I don't think they were joking around. Today at lunch I got to listen to Albert Sandy brag about how his parents bought him a 36 inch t.v. and a DVD player and a bunch of other stuff for his bedroom. It really makes me mad because my whole goal this summer was to save up for a t.v. so I didn't have to hang out with the rest of my family and watch what they want to watch all the time. So I spent the whole summer taking care of Mr. and Mrs. Rose's dog while they were on a trip."
